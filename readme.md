Generative + Traditional Music Composer

WIP

- focused on keyboard control

- sequencer (piano roll)
- patterns + pattern chaining -- patterns of any length
- coloration of different instruments -- spread out each pattern vertically within the instrument layer
- some kind of preview based on note content in the pattern

- basic sound palette
- basic synth
- drum

- keyboard -- playing notes, step sequence into sequencer --- map to computer keyboard
- restrict to key / scale -- identify root note (and other important notes)
- play chords in key -- push to sequencer
- chord progression generator
- arpeggio breakdown

more advanced generative
- modal hints (avoid V, etc)
- chromaticism hints (when to use?) / highlight
- pattern generator / partial-full randomizer + repetition?

- midi export

mvp+

- euclidian
